# ReaverLib

ReaverLib is a collection of libraries used throughout the project, that should
also be useful for people from outside of it.

## Supported compilers

Currently supported compilers include GCC 5.1+ and Clang 3.7+, both with libstdc++
and libc++, and with Boost 1.60.0+. It probably also works on lower versions, but
no such compatibility will be checked and maintained.

CI status can be checked on [Reaver Project's TeamCity server](http://ci.reaver-project.org/viewType.html?buildTypeId=reaverlib_Tests&guest=1).
